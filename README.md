# odin-recipes
This is the Recipes Project from the foundation course of the Odin Project.
The purpose of this project is to build a basic recipe website by using basic HTML tags.
This project will include HTML tags like HTML boilerplate, <h1>, <strong>, <p>, etc.
The recipes in this project are not mine. They are from [allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/).
